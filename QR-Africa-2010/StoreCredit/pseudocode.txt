
> Items to a list
	- N = number of case
	- Get first test case
		- C = credits to store
		- I = number of items
	- Place into array
		- Create an array that is the size I
		- For each entry, enter value

> Solve problem
	- For each test case, start by creating to integers x and y for the cost of 
		the items
	- Begin by adding the first item in the array to the later items to see
		if any of them add to C.
	- If not, continue with the second and the rest
